# solx — development

Contributor + maintainer guide for the `solx` CLI. End-user docs live
in [`README.md`](README.md). The Sol-skill agent skill at
`../skills/sol-skill/` is intentionally untouched by `solx` work in
this stage; that integration is Stage 3 (deferred — see
[`../docs/stage-3-integration.md`](../docs/stage-3-integration.md)).

## Architecture

Nine Python modules. Each is small and has one job:

```
solx/src/solx/
├── __init__.py         # version constant
├── __main__.py         # `python -m solx` entry
├── cli.py              # Typer wiring; nothing happens in here, just dispatch
├── config.py           # XDG TOML loader + dataclasses + pathspec compilation
├── output.py           # Out: JSON-vs-Rich auto-detect + stdout/stderr split
├── side.py             # Sol-vs-not-Sol guard (each subcommand asks require_sol)
├── slurm.py            # squeue/scancel/salloc/srun wrappers + verb-aware resolution
├── jobs.py             # `solx job *` command bodies
├── keep.py             # `solx keep` (port of sol_renew.py, file-level sharded)
└── init.py             # `solx init` (write starter config.toml)
```

### Design notes worth knowing about

- **No persistent state.** `solx` queries `squeue -u $USER` whenever it
  needs to know what jobs you have. There's no `session.json`, no
  stale-state class of bugs. Cost: one squeue call per command — fine
  on a login node.
- **Slurm is the source of truth.** Job-id resolution
  (`stop`/`jump`/`time`) reads `$SLURM_JOB_ID` if set (compute-node
  default), then asks squeue. It's **verb-aware** (`slurm.Resolution`):
  with ≥2 jobs, `time`/`jump` auto-pick the most recent (highest job id,
  `most_recent()`), while `stop` never guesses and exits 2 with the
  candidate list — a wrong cancel is irreversible. Acting from inside an
  allocation triggers a nesting heads-up (`jump`) or self-cancel confirm
  (`stop`). Rationale lives in the design panel synthesis; summary in
  [`../docs/solx.md`](../docs/solx.md#leaving-out-the-job-id).
- **Output is `Out` (`output.py`), not bare `print`/`Console`.** Each
  command body takes an `Out` that decides JSON vs Rich (auto: JSON when
  stdout isn't a TTY; global `--json` forces it) and splits streams —
  results to stdout, every diagnostic to stderr. Destructive commands
  refuse (`exit 2`) in a non-interactive session rather than hang on a
  prompt. Tests build an `Out` over `StringIO` consoles with an explicit
  mode (see `make_out` in `tests/test_jobs.py` / `test_keep.py`).
- **`Runner` injection** in `slurm.py`. Every subprocess call goes
  through a `Runner` callable that takes argv and returns
  `(returncode, stdout, stderr)`. Tests pass synthetic runners that
  return canned output without spawning subprocesses. The real runner
  is `slurm.real_runner`.
- **`salloc --no-shell`, not `sbatch --wrap='sleep infinity'`.** Sol
  has Slurm 25.x; the native primitive is available. Cleaner `seff`
  output, no `sleep` process billed against the allocation. Jobid is
  parsed from salloc's stderr (`Granted job allocation N`) — well-known
  Slurm output that's been stable for years.
- **No `[shared]` merge in config.** Each `[jobs.<name>]` is
  self-contained. The trade: simpler schema, slightly more typing if
  you want a flag in every template. Worth it; merge logic was
  contributing more confusion than savings.
- **`keep` mirrors `sol_renew.py`** — same CSV-driven mechanism, same
  flag surface (`--stage`, `--csv-dir`, `-j`, `-n`, `-v`). The keep list
  lives in `[keep]` config now instead of `~/.solkeep`; the original
  ethical posture (only renew what Sol has flagged) carries over.
  Execution is **file-level sharded** (mirrors `sol_renew.py` PR #18):
  `_pick_lister` (fd/rg/find) → `enumerate_dir` → `shard` → `touch_files`
  on a bounded streaming window, so `-j` scales the biggest single
  directory, not just the directory count. `_execute` has a serial
  `jobs_n<=1` fast path (no process pool) used by tests and the
  end-to-end real-touch test.
- **Top-level shortcut for `jump`.** `solx jump` and `solx job jump`
  both work. The verb you reach for most earns the shortcut. No other
  verbs get this treatment; it'd make help-text noisy.

### Aliases — what's wired

- `solx job *` and `solx jobs *` resolve to the same Typer subgroup
  (registered twice in `cli.py`).
- `solx job ls` and `solx job list` are separate commands sharing the
  same body (`hidden=True` on `ls`).
- `solx jump` (top-level) and `solx job jump` are separate commands
  sharing the same body.
- All exercised by `tests/test_cli.py::test_*alias*` — if you change a
  command name, those tests fail loudly.

## Testing

```shell
cd solx
uv sync                # one-time
uv run pytest          # full suite
uv run pytest -v       # verbose
uv run pytest tests/test_jobs.py::test_start_passthrough_appended -v
```

The whole suite runs in well under a second. We aim to keep it that
way — no real subprocess spawning, no real disk other than `tmp_path`.

### Coverage targets

| Module | What's tested |
|---|---|
| `side.py` | `detect()` parsing branches (Sol login, Sol compute, not-Sol, FQDN-only fallback). |
| `config.py` | TOML schema parse, every required-key error, type errors, `pathspec` glob compilation, `parse_duration`, XDG fallback, **starter config round-trips through `load()`** (so `solx init` output is always valid), **starter config has no maintainer name baked in** (`sparky` only). |
| `output.py` | `Out.auto` force/auto-detect, stdout/stderr split, clean JSON emission, `emit` json-vs-human branch. |
| `slurm.py` | `squeue` row parsing; verb-aware `resolve_jobid` (arg / env / single / zero, stop-ambiguous-no-autopick, time-most-recent, jump-running-only + no-running); `most_recent` (highest id, array ids); every argv builder; `parse_granted_jobid`; `run_salloc` success + failure. |
| `jobs.py` | `cmd_list` (empty / populated / squeue-fail / **JSON**), `cmd_start` (default template, dry-run, passthrough, salloc failure, unknown template, **JSON jobid**), `cmd_stop` (`-y`/`-n` mutex, dry-run, prompt proceed/abort, **non-interactive refuse**, ambiguous-no-autopick + JSON candidates, self-cancel warning, JSON), `cmd_jump` (arg, **inside warn-and-proceed**, `-q` suppress, most-recent, no-running), `cmd_time` (arg, JSON, most-recent). |
| `keep.py` | CSV parsing, `build_plan` filter + dedup + exclude carve-out, `shard`/`enumerate_dir`/`touch_files` units, `cmd_keep` `-y`/`-n` mutex, no-`[keep]` exit 2, dry-run no-execute, prompt branches, **non-interactive refuse**, single-stage filter, failure propagation, JSON summary + dry-run plan, **end-to-end real-touch** (recursion + carve-out + non-kept). |
| `init.py` | Fresh write, parent-dir creation, mode 0600, refuse-existing-without-force, `--force` overwrite, prompt-and-confirm. |
| `cli.py` | Every command + alias path dispatches via `CliRunner`. Body itself is mocked — `cli.py` tests verify wiring, not behavior. |

### Test fixtures

- `tests/conftest.py::_isolate_slurm_env` (autouse) clears `SLURM_*`
  env vars before each test. The dev machine is Sol itself; pytest
  may be invoked from inside an allocation. Tests that *want*
  `$SLURM_JOB_ID` set must `monkeypatch.setenv` it explicitly.
- `config_path` / `write_config` for TOML round-trip tests.
- `SAMPLE_CONFIG_TOML` exports a known-good full config.

## Manual smoke on Sol

The unit tests cover every code path that doesn't require real
cluster round-trips. The smoke checklist below validates the round
trips. `htc`/`debug` queues in seconds, so a full lifecycle takes
under two minutes.

After `ssh sparky@sol.asu.edu` (with your ASURITE):

1. **Install fresh**:
   ```shell
   uv tool install --reinstall git+https://github.com/Shu-Wan/sol-skills.git#subdirectory=solx
   solx --version
   ```

2. **Init + show**:
   ```shell
   solx init
   solx config show
   solx config show --json | jq .
   ```

3. **Edit config** to add a real `[keep]` include path you actually
   own:
   ```shell
   solx config edit
   ```

4. **Dry-run before any live allocation**:
   ```shell
   solx job start debug --dry-run
   # prints the salloc argv; verify partition/time/qos look right
   ```

5. **Live allocation lifecycle**:
   ```shell
   solx job start debug
   # waits a few seconds for queue grant, prints "allocated job N"
   solx job list
   # table shows the new job, state RUNNING
   solx job time
   # prints D-HH:MM:SS remaining (no-arg path: sole running job)
   solx job jump
   # drops into your default_shell on the compute node
   exit
   # back to login shell; allocation still alive
   solx job stop
   # prompts "Cancel job N? [y/N]" — type y
   solx job list
   # the job is gone
   ```

6. **`-y` skip + `-n` preview** for `solx job stop`:
   ```shell
   solx job start debug
   jid=$(solx job list | awk 'NR==2 {print $1}')   # or eyeball it
   solx job stop "$jid" -n
   # prints scancel argv; nothing happens
   solx job stop "$jid" -y
   # cancels without prompting
   ```

7. **Verb-aware job-id resolution edge cases**:
   ```shell
   # no jobs:        solx job time  → exit 1, "no jobs found"
   # start two debug jobs, then with NO arg:
   #   solx job time → picks the most recent (higher jobid), note on stderr, exit 0
   #   solx job jump → attaches to the most recent running job, exit 0
   #   solx job stop → prints the candidate table, exit 2 (never guesses)
   # inside an allocation (after `solx job jump`):
   #   solx job stop → "Cancel job N (the one you're inside)?" self-cancel confirm
   #   solx job jump → warns about nesting, still attaches (-q silences)
   ```

7a. **Agent / non-interactive behavior** (no TTY):
   ```shell
   solx job list | jq .                 # JSON array (auto-detected off-TTY)
   solx job time </dev/null             # bare D-HH:MM:SS on stdout
   solx job stop 999 </dev/null         # exit 2: "non-interactive — pass -y…"
   solx --json job time                 # {"jobid":…,"time_left":…} even on a TTY
   ```

8. **Compute-node default-jobid**:
   ```shell
   solx job start debug
   solx job jump
   # on the compute node now:
   solx job time          # uses $SLURM_JOB_ID, no arg needed
   exit
   solx job stop -y
   ```

9. **Scratch renewal** (only if Sol has flagged something for you;
   otherwise skip — there's nothing to demo):
   ```shell
   ls ~/scratch-dirs-*.csv 2>/dev/null
   # if any exist:
   solx keep --dry-run -v
   # plan summary; verify the kept list looks right
   solx keep
   # prompts "Touch mtimes on N directories? [y/N]" — type y
   ```

10. **Wrong-side guard** (run on a laptop, not Sol):
    ```shell
    solx --version    # works
    solx --help       # works
    solx job list     # exit 2 with "solx is Sol-only — SSH first"
    solx keep         # same
    ```

11. **Aliases**:
    ```shell
    solx jobs list    # same as solx job list
    solx job ls       # same
    solx jump 12345   # same as solx job jump 12345
    ```

12. **Completions**:
    ```shell
    solx completions zsh > /tmp/solx.zsh
    source /tmp/solx.zsh
    solx <TAB>        # subcommands appear
    solx job s<TAB>   # start, stop appear
    ```

## Releasing

There is no published release cadence yet — `solx` is pre-1.0 and
shipped via `uv tool install` from the Git repo directly. When we cut
a tag:

1. Bump `solx/src/solx/__init__.py::__version__` and
   `solx/pyproject.toml::version` (keep them matched).
2. Run the full test suite + at least the smoke flow above.
3. Tag at the repo root: `git tag solx-vX.Y.Z` (prefix to distinguish
   from skill tags, which are unprefixed `vX.Y.Z`).
4. Push the tag.

## When in doubt

- The user-facing behavior of `solx` lives in the manual
  [`../docs/solx.md`](../docs/solx.md); the roadmap and design decisions are
  in [`../docs/PLAN.md`](../docs/PLAN.md). When code and docs disagree, raise
  it — usually the code is right and the doc needs an update, but check.
- The agent skill at `../skills/sol-skill/` is hands-off in this
  stage. Don't add `solx` references there; that's Stage 3.
- The repo root `README.md` and `DEVELOPMENT.md` describe the **agent
  skill**, not `solx`. Keep `solx`-specific content here.
