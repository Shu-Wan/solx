# Development

This doc is for contributors and the maintainer. End-user docs live in
`README.md` (CLI + skill install) and `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md` (skill
content). Public-facing test methodology lives in
[`docs/coverage.md`](docs/coverage.md).

```

Keep real eval prompts and assertions in the gitignored `evals/evals.json`.
Benchmark output belongs in `evals/results/`, live transcripts and workspaces
belong in `sol-skill-workspace/`, and L3 checklist results stay in maintainer
notes. These files may contain ASURITEs, project paths, or non-deterministic
output. Commit only the sanitized template, mocks, runner, skill, CLI, and
public coverage summary. `docs/coverage.md` is the public verification surface;
more specific results stay local.

Required tools:

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the eval harness.
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable for the `solx` crate.
- The [`claude` CLI](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) for eval
  subagents.
- The [`skill-creator`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins)
  skill for `aggregate_benchmark.py`, `eval-viewer/`, and `run_loop.py`.

The shipped `solx` binary is static and does not require `uv` or a Rust
toolchain.

## Skill design

These are load-bearing for the skill's quality. Apply them when
adding or revising any section.

**Situational guidance.**

This skill is not an "SSH skill", not a "Slurm skill", not a "Python
skill". It is a **situational guide**: the user is trying to get
something done on Sol, and the skill teaches *which Sol-specific path
is right for the situation*. The underlying techniques (SSH port
forwarding, sbatch headers, environment modules) aren't the
contribution - the situational mapping is.

Every section in `SKILL.md` should open with the situation it
addresses, not the technique it employs. Compare:

- ✗ Technique-first: *"Sol uses SSH port forwarding to expose
  compute-node services. Run `ssh -L ... -J ...` to forward a port..."*
- ✓ Situation-first: *"The user wants a Jupyter notebook running on
  a Sol GPU and wants to open it in their laptop browser. Three
  paths exist: Open OnDemand for casual use, `solx` if installed,
  manual SSH chain otherwise."*

If a section reads like a manual page for a generic technique,
rewrite it. The agent already knows generic techniques from training
data; what it doesn't know is which one Sol's setup makes
appropriate, and why.

**Content placement.**

**Load-bearing decision rules belong in `SKILL.md` itself.** Anything
the agent needs to make a *correct decision* - partition choice,
refusal patterns, branching logic, default substitutions - should be
visible without requiring a separate Read of a reference file.
Reserve `references/` for the detail that backs those decisions:
worked examples, full command tables, syntax minutiae, troubleshooting.

This isn't a stylistic preference - it's load-bearing for robustness.
A skill that buries critical guidance in `references/` is fragile to:

- `claude -p --print` mode (reference Reads need explicit permission
  and may be denied silently)
- Symlinked dev trees that fall outside Claude Code's per-session
  directory-access guardrails
- Subagent invocations with restricted tool sets
- Any other situation where the agent can't (or chooses not to) take
  a Read tool turn

Iteration 3 of this skill caught exactly this failure mode: a "use
`htc` for lightweight debug" rule lived only in
`references/sessions.md`, was invisible to `claude -p`, and the
agent defaulted to `general`. Promoting the same rule into
`SKILL.md` (iter-4) fixed it immediately and the rule even
generalized to adjacent prompts.

When in doubt, ask: "if the agent never reads this reference, would
its answer still be correct on this topic?" If no, the rule
belongs up in `SKILL.md`.

## Evaluation

`sol-skill` is mostly **decision** and **refusal** logic that only
matters on Sol: "use `$(whoami)`, not `<asurite>`", "don't `find
/scratch -exec touch`", "branch on `command -v solx`", "load the
`scratch.md` reference before touching scratch". skill-creator's
default loop assumes test prompts produce *files* that you grade - but
we shouldn't actually call `srun` or open ssh tunnels from a laptop
during eval, and we don't have admin on Sol either way.

So evals are sliced into four layers, each runnable in a different
environment, each graded differently.

- **L0 - Triggering.** Runs anywhere with `claude -p`. It checks whether
  the frontmatter invokes the skill for Sol prompts and excludes near-misses.
  `skill-creator/scripts/run_loop.py` grades the result.
- **L1 - Static.** Runs on a laptop or Sol login node without executing the
  proposed operations. Transcript checks catch bad placeholders or storage,
  missing reference reads, `sudo`, bulk touches, SSH-config reads, and missing
  `command -v solx` branches.
- **L2 - Mocked Sol.** Runs the CLI and agent output against the userland
  mocks. Assertions cover exit codes, stdout, stderr, filesystem changes, CSV
  parsing, keep-list matching, host detection, and confirmation behavior. The
  crate's keep tests cover timestamp renewal; static mock CSVs support L1.
- **L3 - Real Sol smoke.** Runs manually on Sol for behavior that mocks cannot
  establish: modules, `srun`, SSH tunnels, `vscode`, startup latency, and
  schedulable partition/QOS/GRES/time combinations. The checklist uses
  `evals/runner/bench_solx_latency.sh` and `l3_sbatch_test_only` assertions.

The classification lives **in the eval file** - each assertion is
tagged `layer: L1 | L2 | L3` so the runner picks the right execution
mode and the public coverage doc can show pass-rate per layer
separately, not just an overall number.

### Local environment

The thing that makes L2 work. Plain shell + tiny Python - no
framework. The mocks are small enough to read in a sitting; if you
need to extend them, treat the existing files as the contract.

```text
evals/mocks/
├── activate.sh                    # prepends bin/ and sets fake HOME
├── bin/                           # PATH shims (executable)
│   ├── hostname                   # fake `sc001.sol.rc.asu.edu`, configurable
│   ├── module                     # canned module avail/load/list output
│   ├── srun, sbatch, scancel, squeue   # log args, return canned exit
│   └── ssh                        # log args, never connect
├── home/                          # fake $HOME during eval
│   ├── .config/solx/config.toml   # example config with a [keep] block
│   └── scratch-dirs-*.csv         # synthetic Sol warning files
└── scratch/swan16/                # fake scratch tree under fake $HOME
```

Every mock invocation is appended to `$MOCK_LOG`
(default: `/tmp/sol-skill-mock-$$.log`). Assertions can grep this log
to verify "agent called `srun --partition=lightwork`" without needing
a real scheduler.

To toggle whether the mock pretends to be Sol or a laptop, set
`MOCK_HOSTNAME` before sourcing `activate.sh`. The default is the
Sol-side value (`sc001.sol.rc.asu.edu`). The `solx` binary is
intentionally **absent** from `bin/` - that's how we exercise the
"command -v solx returns nothing" branch. Drop a `solx` shim into
`bin/` only when testing the `solx`-present branch.

```shell
cd /path/to/sol-skill
source evals/mocks/activate.sh
hostname -a                                  # -> sc001.sol.rc.asu.edu
solx keep --dry-run -v
cat "$MOCK_LOG"                              # see what was invoked
```

The full harness requires `uv`, the `claude` CLI, and the `skill-creator`
skill listed under [Repository and tools](#repository-and-tools).

**Baseline isolation.**

Skill-creator compares **with-skill** runs against **baseline** runs.
If `sol-skill` is installed at user scope (`~/.claude/skills/sol-skill/`),
every subagent - baseline included - sees it, and the comparison is
meaningless.

The fix is to relocate Claude Code's config dir for the eval session
*only*. Claude Code reads its config from `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set
(verified in the v2.1.117 binary), falling back to `~/.claude/`. The
`evals/runner/build_sandbox_home.sh` script builds a mirror config dir
that symlinks everything from your real `~/.claude/` *except* the
`sol-skill` skill - so auth, plugins, every other skill, and your
settings all carry over, but `sol-skill` is invisible to baselines.

```shell
SANDBOX=$(./evals/runner/build_sandbox_home.sh)
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX claude     # start the eval-orchestrator session here
```

Other terminals running `claude` continue to see your real config and
the user-scope `sol-skill` install - parallel work is unaffected.

Inside the sandboxed session:

- **with-skill subagent** is given the dev tree explicitly via
  `--plugin-dir skills/sol-skill` (or skill-creator's `--skill` arg in
  newer versions).
- **baseline subagent** gets no skill arg; the sandbox config has no
  `sol-skill`, so the comparison is fair.

To hide a different skill (e.g., when iterating on a sibling skill):

```shell
./evals/runner/build_sandbox_home.sh --hide-skill other-skill
```

To verify the sandbox is taking effect, start a `claude -p` against
it and ask "list available skills" - `sol-skill` should be missing.

### Run evaluations

```shell
# 1. Build the sandbox (first time, or whenever ~/.claude changes)
SANDBOX=$(./evals/runner/build_sandbox_home.sh)

# 2. Lay out a fresh iteration
WORKSPACE=sol-skill-workspace/iteration-1
mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE"

# 3. Run all evals from inside the sandboxed session.
#    Spawns one with-skill + one baseline subagent per eval. Use
#    --permission-mode acceptEdits when the runner shells out to
#    `claude -p`, otherwise reference Reads will be denied silently
#    and the skill will be measured at less than its real capability.
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX \
  python -m evals.runner --evals evals/evals.json --workspace "$WORKSPACE"

# 4. Aggregate (uses skill-creator's aggregator)
python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark "$WORKSPACE" --skill-name sol-skill

# 5. View
python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \
  "$WORKSPACE" \
  --skill-name sol-skill \
  --benchmark "$WORKSPACE/benchmark.json"
```

### Add evaluations

1. Open `evals/evals.json` (or `evals/evals.example.json` if you don't
   have a private set yet).
2. Append an entry with these fields:
   - `id`, `prompt`, `expected_output` - standard skill-creator schema
   - `assertions[]` - each assertion is `{text, layer, check}` where
     `layer` is `"L1"|"L2"|"L3"` and `check` is one of:
     - `"transcript_contains": "..."` / `"transcript_lacks": "..."`
     - `"file_exists": "..."` / `"file_contains": {...}`
     - `"exit_code": 0` (L2 only - the runner captures the script's
       exit code)
     - `"mock_log_contains": "..."` (L2 only - greps `$MOCK_LOG`)
     - `"manual"` (L3 only - surfaces in the manual checklist)
3. If the eval needs a specific mock state (e.g., `solx` present, or a
   different `[keep]` config), add a `setup` block that the runner sources
   before spawning the subagent.

Keep prompts concrete and realistic - see the skill-creator
description-optimization guide for what makes a good prompt.

## Releases

The CLI and the skill share one version line; a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag
triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` (build the static musl binary,
publish the GitHub Release with it attached). Before tagging:

1. Bump the version in `solx/Cargo.toml` and `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`
   (`version:`); refresh `solx/Cargo.lock` (`cargo update -p solx`). The
   release workflow refuses to publish if the tag, `Cargo.toml`, and
   `SKILL.md` disagree.
2. Run the full eval suite locally (L1 + L2) and `solx`'s test suite
   (`cd solx && cargo test`).
3. Walk the L3 manual checklist on real Sol (login + compute node).
4. Hand-edit `docs/coverage.md`: bump the "Last verified" date, flip
   any cells in the matrix, refresh "Known gaps", and bump its
   `**Version:**` line. Move the `[Unreleased]` notes under a
   `## [X.Y.Z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`, **and update the
   link-reference footer at the bottom** (repoint `[Unreleased]` to
   `compare/vX.Y.Z...HEAD` and add a `[X.Y.Z]` release-tag target) - a
   missed footer leaves the new heading as a dead link. The README's
   version is shown by the dynamic Release badge, so it needs no edit.
5. If the release added a user-visible capability, touch the "What this
   skill helps with" bullets in `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`.
6. Commit the docs on the release commit, then tag `vX.Y.Z` and push -
   CI builds and publishes the release.

Validate the skill with `gh skills publish --dry-run` from a clean checkout
before tagging. For this combined CLI and skill repository, let CI create the
release with its binary attached. `gh skills publish --tag` creates a published
release immediately; with immutable releases enabled, the later CI upload is
rejected. `gh skills install` can install the skill from the CI-published tag.

**CLI-only releases skip the skill eval re-run.** When a release changes
only the `solx` crate and leaves the skill's guidance content unchanged
(everything under `skills/sol-skill/` identical apart from the shared
`version:` line), the L1/L2/L3 *skill* evals in steps 2-3 don't need
re-running - they still hold, because the skill itself is unchanged. The
gate for such a release is the crate's own `cargo test` suite plus an L3
*CLI* smoke on real Sol (the shipped binary still needs exercising). A
release that touches skill prose, references, or decision rules must run
the skill evals. (1.0.2 - the nested `job jump` fix - was CLI-only.)
