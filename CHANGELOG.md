# Changelog

All notable changes to **solx** — the CLI and its agent skill — are
recorded here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
and the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

From v0.4.0 the CLI and the skill share **one version line**: each entry's
version matches the `version` field in [`solx/Cargo.toml`](solx/Cargo.toml)
and in [`skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`](skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md), and the git
tag, and a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag builds and publishes the release.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-15

Skill guidance for AI agents — framing/packaging changes, no new
commands (issue #36).

### Added

- **Proactive "job is PENDING" playbook** in the skill body
  (`SKILL.md` → Situation-Aware Job Management). An ordered decision
  tree: get cause + ETA up front (`squeue --me -t PD -O JobID,Reason`,
  `scontrol show job`), classify the `Reason` (`Priority` →
  priority-bound, report and wait; `ReqNodeNotAvail` → node unavailable,
  drained/down or reserved; `Resources` → capacity-bound, a reroute can
  help), right-size, and —
  when a reroute is warranted — modify the job in place with `scontrol
  update job` rather than `scancel` + `sbatch` (which forfeits accrued
  priority). The point: an agent should
  *diagnose and report* a stuck queue (cause + ETA + whether routing
  helps) instead of parking it or spraying jobs across partitions.
  Backing detail (full `Reason` taxonomy) in `references/slurm.md`; a
  compact version in the cheat sheet.

### Changed

- **Status-query guidance now tags commands by audience.** The "Asking
  the Cluster About Yourself and Your Jobs" table and the cheat sheet's
  wrappers table separate the **agent-parseable** form (SLURM-native /
  `--json` / `-O`) from the **human-facing** `my*`/`show*` wrapper, with
  the rule: for an agent, default to the parseable form; reach for a
  color-coded wrapper only to show a human (or for `myfairshare`'s
  dampened score). The "free GPUs" answer parses cleanly via `sinfo`
  (`Gres` − `GresUsed`) instead of the color-coded `showgpus`, and the
  pending-diagnosis commands widen the `Reason` column so a multi-word
  reason (`ReqNodeNotAvail, UnavailableNodes:…`) isn't truncated.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-10

solx is now a single native binary (Rust); the Python implementation is
retired. Every command starts in ~1ms with no Python interpreter and no
per-module NFS reads, so startup no longer degrades under node load or a
cold NFS cache. Install is one static file — download and `chmod +x` — with
no `uv`, no Python, and no toolchain on the box.

### Highlights

Startup latency, warm median on a Sol compute node (NFS `$HOME`):

| command | raw `squeue` | v0.5.0 (Python) | **v1.0 (Rust)** | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `solx --version` | — | 0.10s | **0.010s** | 10× |
| `solx job list` | 0.08s | 0.39s | **0.12s** | 3.3× |
| `solx job time` | 0.08s | 0.31s | **0.12s** | 2.6× |

The binary tracks raw `squeue` — its residual over `squeue` is just the
`squeue` subprocess it spawns — and, unlike the Python builds, its startup
is flat regardless of node load or cache state. ~4.9MB, no runtime
dependencies (no Python, `uv`, or `rustc` on the target).

### Added

- **`solx cheatsheet`** — prints the Sol quick reference (SLURM basics,
  `solx` ↔ raw SLURM, the partition/QOS table, Sol's `my*`/`show*`
  wrappers, laptop tunnels) as text. It's embedded from the skill's single
  source `skills/sol-skill/references/cheatsheet.md`, so the CLI, the
  rendered [`docs/cheatsheet.pdf`](docs/cheatsheet.pdf), and the skill
  reference can't drift. Wired into the bash/zsh/fish completions.
- **The Sol cheat sheet** in the skill —
  `skills/sol-skill/references/cheatsheet.md`, with a centered README nav
  and a `scripts/build-cheatsheet.sh` PDF build.
- **Eval-harness L3 grader `l3_sbatch_test_only`** — validates an agent's
  recommended `#SBATCH` header against the live scheduler (`sbatch
  --test-only`), catching partition/QOS combos that read plausibly but the
  scheduler rejects (e.g. `-p htc -q debug`).

### Changed

- **The CLI is rewritten in Rust** (the `solx/` crate), preserving the
  v0.5.0 command surface, output contract, and exit codes; behavioral
  parity was verified during the port and is locked going forward by the
  crate's test suite (`solx/tests/cli.rs` + unit vectors). The agent
  skill's operational guidance is unchanged apart from the install steps,
  the dropped `~/.solkeep` fallback (below), and the partition/QOS rework
  (next).
- **SLURM partition/QOS guidance reworked.** The skill routes jobs by
  wall-time and priority, not CPU-vs-GPU: ≤4h work (GPUs included) → `htc`;
  a ≤15-minute urgent check → `-p public -q debug`; longer runs → `public`
  (or `general` with `-q private` for preemptible buy-in nodes). This
  fixes the "GPU → `public`" reflex that parked short GPU jobs behind
  multi-day ones. The Submitting-Jobs section is promoted ahead of storage
  and gains a personalized "know your access" step (`sacctmgr show assoc`).
  Factual corrections verified against the live scheduler: `htc` carries
  H200 nodes; `highmem`'s wall is 7 days; there is no `myquota` wrapper
  (use `beegfs-ctl --getquota`); `sq` is the whole-cluster queue, not
  `squeue --me`.
- **Install is a prebuilt static binary.** Download
  `solx-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` from the release, `chmod +x`, and drop
  it on `PATH`. The `curl install.sh | sh` and `uv tool install` channels
  are gone, along with their `uv`/Python requirement. See
  [`solx/README.md`](solx/README.md).

### Removed

- **The Python implementation.** The Typer-then-`argparse` CLI that lived
  at `solx/` — its test suite, the `.pyz` zipapp build (`build-pyz.sh`),
  `install.sh`, and the `uv tool` install channel — is deleted. `solx/`
  now holds the Rust crate, the only solx; the `.pyz` and `uv` install
  channels no longer exist.
- **`~/.solkeep` support, end to end.** The config `[keep]` block is now
  the only keep-list source: `solx keep` never reads a `~/.solkeep` (the
  implicit fallback, deprecated since 0.4.0, was slated for 1.0.0), and the
  `solx config import-solkeep` command and the `--solkeep <file>` flag are
  removed with it. With no `[keep]` block, `keep` errors and points at
  `solx config edit`.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **`install.sh` produced an unrunnable `solx`.** The installer rebound the
  zipapp's interpreter by swapping the shebang bytes in place, but a zipapp
  records its central-directory offsets as absolute file positions that
  include the shebang line — replacing it with a different-length path
  shifted every offset, so `zipimport` (which executes the archive) rejected
  it with "bad central directory size or offset" and `solx` died on startup
  with `SyntaxError: source code cannot contain null bytes`. Since the build
  stamps the CI runner's long interpreter path, no local path matched its
  length and essentially every `.pyz` install was broken. The installer now
  extracts the payload and rebuilds the archive around the local interpreter
  (which regenerates the offsets) and smoke-tests the result before
  reporting success, falling back to a uv-managed interpreter if the
  resolved one can't run a zipapp. `zipfile` tolerated the corrupted archive
  on read, which is why the build's own check never caught it.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-10

The CLI's dispatch layer is rewritten on the Python standard library and
startup latency drops to the same order as a raw SLURM call, so the
skill no longer steers agents to raw `squeue` for one-off reads.

### Highlights

Startup latency, warm median on a Sol compute node (NFS `$HOME`, the
single-file `.pyz` install `install.sh` writes to `~/.local/bin`):

| command | raw `squeue` | v0.4.0 | **v0.5.0** | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `solx --version` | — | 1.35s | **0.10s** | 13× |
| `solx job list` | 0.08s | 2.51s | **0.39s** | 6.4× |
| `solx job time` | 0.08s | 2.51s | **0.31s** | 8.1× |

A `solx job` read now costs the same order as a raw SLURM call. Absolute
startup over NFS scales with node load — Python pays a per-module open
storm, so v0.4.0 can reach ~2.5s under contention — and the win is
removing that import tree. On node-local disk the floor is lower still
(`--version` ~0.02s).

### Upgrading

- Completion scripts installed as files must be regenerated after
  upgrading — for the zsh fpath install:
  `solx completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_solx`. Scripts generated by solx
  ≤ 0.4.0 call back into `solx` with `_SOLX_COMPLETE` set (the Typer
  runtime protocol); 0.5.0 answers that protocol with zero candidates,
  so a stale script completes nothing until regenerated. The
  eval/source install modes regenerate the script each shell and need
  no action.

### Added

- `evals/parity/` — a behavioral parity matrix for the CLI: 80 cases
  covering the full command surface (including `job start` `--`
  shielding, bundled shorts, and version/keep validation edges), each
  run in an isolated fake `$HOME` against deterministic SLURM mocks,
  compared byte-for-byte against a captured golden run. Used to verify
  the dispatch rewrite reproduces v0.4.0 behavior; goldens are
  environment-captured, not committed. See `evals/parity/README.md`.

### Changed

- **CLI dispatch is stdlib `argparse`** (`solx/src/solx/main.py`; entry
  point `solx.main:main`, replacing `solx.cli:app`). Importing the entry
  module costs nothing beyond the interpreter baseline:
  `--version`/`version` short-circuit before the parser tree is built,
  command bodies import inside their handlers, and `--json`/piped runs
  never load `rich`. Command surface, aliases, exit codes, and the
  output contract are unchanged apart from the two documented supersets
  below (`--json` placement and `-h`); verified with `evals/parity/`.
- **Startup latency** drops to the order of a raw SLURM call (see
  Highlights above): removing the
  Typer/`click`/`rich` import tree cuts a `solx job` read from seconds to
  ~0.1–0.4s warm on the NFS `$HOME` install, ~13× / 6.4× / 8.1× over
  v0.4.0 on `--version` / `job list` / `job time`. On node-local disk the
  floor is lower still (`--version` ~0.02s). SKILL.md and the manual now
  treat `solx` and raw SLURM reads as equivalent.
- **Static shell completions**: `solx completions <bash|zsh|fish>`
  renders the command surface from one description
  (`solx/src/solx/_completions.py`) into fully static scripts — nothing
  execs `solx` at completion time, so the first Tab of a session costs
  no interpreter start. Both zsh install modes (eval/source and fpath
  autoload) keep working; install lines unchanged.
- **`--json` placement is a superset**: still accepted before the
  subcommand (`solx --json job list`), now also after it
  (`solx job list --json`) — except after `job start`, where
  post-command tokens pass through to `salloc`, and on `config edit`,
  `completions`, `version`, and `help`, whose output is one fixed text.
- **`-h` is a superset**: accepted everywhere as a short form of
  `--help` (v0.4.0 took only `--help` and exited 2 on `-h`); `solx -h`
  and every `<command> -h` now print help and exit 0.
- `dist/solx.pyz` is built with the build interpreter's shebang so it
  runs in place; `install.sh` re-stamps the shebang with the destination
  machine's interpreter.

### Removed

- Dependencies `typer` (and with it `click` and `shellingham`). Runtime
  dependencies are now `rich` (human tables and prompts only) and
  `pathspec` (+ the `tomli` backport on Python 3.10).

### Deferred

- `~/.solkeep` removal moves from 0.5.0 to **1.0.0**. `solx keep` keeps
  reading a legacy `~/.solkeep` (with a deprecation notice) through the
  0.5.x line; migrate with `solx config import-solkeep`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-08

`solx` becomes the supported path for interactive jobs and scratch
renewal, and the skill is rewritten to install and drive it. The CLI and
skill move to one version line, and a pushed `vX.Y.Z` tag now builds the
single-file `solx.pyz` and publishes a GitHub Release via CI.

### Added

- `solx config import-solkeep` — migrate a legacy `~/.solkeep` into the
  config `[keep]` block.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + test on push/PR) and
  `release.yml` (on a `vX.Y.Z` tag: verify the tag matches `solx
  --version`, build `solx.pyz`, publish a GitHub Release with `solx.pyz`
  + `install.sh` attached). `curl … install.sh | sh` is the recommended
  install/upgrade on Sol.
- `skills/sol-skill/references/solx.md` — agent-facing `solx` reference.
- Situational job management (closes #9): SKILL.md + `references/slurm.md`
  teach checking `myfairshare` before submitting and backing off when
  it's low (≲0.05 — don't spam the scheduler and waste fairshare),
  tracking the wall-time left on the current allocation, and wrapping up
  / handing off before Slurm reclaims the node; plus a helpful-Sol-commands
  table.

### Changed

- SKILL.md rewritten around `solx`: detect it, install it on first use
  (required for job/scratch work), drive the `solx job` lifecycle and
  `solx keep`, and fall back to raw Slurm only when `solx` is unavailable.
- `references/scratch.md`: renewal via `solx keep` and the config
  `[keep]` block; keep-list pattern syntax retained.
- Repository renamed `Shu-Wan/sol-skills` → `Shu-Wan/solx`; all hardcoded
  install URLs updated. Version reconciled to one line (was: skill 0.3.0,
  solx 0.3.4).
- `solx keep` prints a deprecation notice when it falls back to
  `~/.solkeep`.
- `docs/coverage.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`: updated for the
  above.

### Deprecated

- `~/.solkeep` and the standalone renewal script are superseded by `solx
  keep` + the `[keep]` block. `solx keep` still reads a `~/.solkeep` if
  present; **support is removed in 0.5.0**. Migrate with `solx config
  import-solkeep`.

### Removed

- `skills/sol-skill/scripts/sol_renew.py` — the bundled renewal script;
  use `solx keep`.
- `evals/runner/run_l2_renew.py` — its target was the bundled script; the
  renewal mechanism is now covered by `solx/tests/test_keep.py`
  (including an end-to-end real-touch test).

### Earlier `solx` changes, folded into this release

These landed on `main` after the skill's v0.3.0 tag but were never
released on their own; they ship as part of v0.4.0.

#### solx 0.3.4 — zsh completions work installed on fpath (#26)

- `solx completions zsh` now ends with Click's dual-mode footer instead
  of Typer's bare `compdef`: installed on `fpath`
  (`solx completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_solx`), the autoloaded script
  *calls* the completer, so the first Tab of a session completes instead
  of returning nothing. The eval/source install keeps working unchanged;
  if Typer's template ever stops matching, the script is emitted
  unmodified. bash/fish output untouched.
- Docs (`solx/README.md`, `docs/solx.md`): both zsh install modes, with
  the fpath two-liner as the recommended one.

#### solx 0.3.3 — cold-start latency, single-line help aliases, zipapp scripts

- **Cold-start latency on Sol's NFS home** (where every module import is
  a network round-trip): command implementations, `rich`, and `pathspec`
  now load inside command bodies, so `solx --version`, `--help`, and each
  tab-completion exec import ~150 modules (~780 metadata syscalls)
  instead of ~280 (~1,400).
- `--help` lists each command once: `jobs` is a hidden alias of `job`,
  noted inline on the `job` line.
- New `solx/scripts/build-pyz.sh` + `install.sh`: build and install
  `solx` as a single-file zipapp (`.pyz`) with precompiled bytecode —
  measured 1.6s cold / 0.12s warm vs 4.4s / 0.19s for the venv install
  on Sol. Publishing the artifacts to GitHub Releases is Stage 3
  (v0.4.0); see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

#### solx 0.3.2 — runtime tab completion + `jump --overlap` (#23)

#### solx 0.3.1 — completions under Typer's vendored Click; `version`/`help` aliases (#22)

#### solx 0.3.0 (sub-package)

The `solx/` CLI: agent-friendly output, verb-aware job-id resolution, and a
file-level-sharded `keep` that also reads the skill's `~/.solkeep`. The skill
(`skills/sol-skill/`) is untouched, and `solx` versions independently while
its changes accumulate here — the repo is skill-first until Stage 3 (v0.4.0),
when the two version lines reconcile.

- **Agent-friendly output** (issue #16 / [10 principles for agent-native
  CLIs](https://trevinsays.com/p/10-principles-for-agent-native-clis)): output
  auto-detects — Rich tables on a terminal, JSON when stdout is not a TTY; the
  global `--json` flag forces JSON anywhere. Results go to stdout, all
  diagnostics to stderr. Destructive commands (`job stop`, `keep`) and
  `init`-over-existing **refuse with exit 2** in a non-interactive session
  instead of hanging on a prompt; `-y`/`--yes` and `-f`/`--force` are
  interchangeable for skipping a prompt. `keep`'s JSON is **bounded** — counts +
  a ≤100-item sample + a `full_plan_path` temp-file spill. New
  `solx/src/solx/output.py` (`Out`).
- **Verb-aware job-id resolution**: `job time`/`job jump` auto-pick the most
  recent job (highest job id) when several match; `job stop` never guesses and
  exits 2 to disambiguate. Acting from inside an allocation warns about nesting
  (`jump`, `-q/--quiet` to silence) or self-cancel (`stop`). `slurm.py` returns
  a `Resolution`; adds `most_recent()`.
- **`solx keep`**: file-level sharding (closes #17) mirroring `sol_renew.py`
  PR #18 (streaming pipeline, `fd`/`rg`/`find` enumeration, bounded window);
  plus a keep-list resolved from `--solkeep <file>` > the `[keep]` config block
  > an auto-detected `~/.solkeep`, so the skill's existing `.solkeep` works
  under `solx keep` even with no `solx` config file.
- **`solx init`**: on a terminal, offers a short interactive walkthrough —
  confirm importing an existing `~/.solkeep` into `[keep]`, then pick the shell
  `solx job jump` opens. Skipped in a non-interactive session (which writes
  plain defaults; `solx keep` still reads `~/.solkeep` at runtime).
- **Hardening** (Copilot review): `completions` generated from Click so it
  works under `python -m solx`; `config edit` shlex-splits `$EDITOR`; an
  unreadable config surfaces a clean error; `keep` validates `--csv-dir`.
- New human manual [`docs/solx.md`](docs/solx.md) — the single source of truth
  for `solx` behavior; retired the pre-implementation contract
  `docs/stage-2-solx.md`. Root `README.md` now features `solx`; dropped the
  "Sol-first" phrasing. Test suite 103 → 161.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-28

File-level scratch renewal, faster enumeration, and skill guidance for
where to run it. Closes #17 (see #18).

### Changed

- `scripts/sol_renew.py`: shard the touch pass at the **file** level
  instead of per directory, as a streaming pipeline — enumerate a kept
  directory, then `touch` its files in evenly-sized batches across the
  worker pool, with a bounded in-flight window so peak memory stays a
  small multiple of `-j` regardless of total file count. A single huge
  directory now spreads across the whole pool, so `-j` scales the
  slowest single directory, not just the count of directories.
  Plan/dry-run output is unchanged; exit codes stay `0`/`1`/`2`, with
  `1` now reflecting an enumeration or touch-batch failure rather than
  a per-directory one.
- `scripts/sol_renew.py`: enumeration prefers `fd` (then `rg --files`)
  when on `PATH`, falling back to `find` — the multithreaded walk is
  faster on a large directory. Run with `--hidden --no-ignore` so the
  fast listers match `find -type f` exactly (they skip dotfiles /
  honor `.gitignore` by default, which would otherwise under-protect
  files).
- `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`: add a "Where to run it" decision rule —
  a renewal is metadata-heavy I/O that Sol login nodes throttle, so on
  a login node run the heavy pass on the DTN (`ssh soldtn`), a compute
  node, or a short `htc` job; match `-j` to the node's cores.
- `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`: rewrite the frontmatter `description`
  for triggering — cover the scratch-renewal flow (previously omitted)
  alongside the other domains, with an explicit near-miss guard
  (generic SLURM/HPC on Phoenix/NERSC, cloud GPUs, local-laptop
  tasks). Add a load-bearing safety rule: preview with `--dry-run` or
  confirm scope before the mutating run.
- `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`: the example `.solkeep` now carves out
  regenerable trees (`.venv`/`.git`/`__pycache__`/`node_modules`)
  under every kept path, with the reasoning — renewing them spends the
  pass on files that rebuild for free.
- `references/scratch.md`: document the streaming/file-level design,
  the `fd`/`rg`/`find` lister selection, the per-batch failure
  granularity, and the non-interactive `uv`-on-`PATH` gotcha for
  `ssh soldtn`.

### Added

- `evals/runner/run_l2_renew.py`: a runnable L2 eval that builds its
  own sandbox (real files + stale mtimes, incl. `.venv`/`__pycache__`)
  and asserts the renewal's filesystem mutations — dry-run touches
  nothing, kept files refresh recursively, `.solkeep` carve-outs are
  left alone, non-kept dirs are skipped. Closes the gap where the
  static mock CSVs (absolute `/scratch` paths) couldn't prove real
  touching.

### Deferred

- Mirror the file-level sharding into `solx keep` (`solx/src/solx/keep.py`)
  once the `solx` CLI lands on `main`. Tracked in #17.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-28

Partition rename: ASU Research Computing retired the `general`
partition in favor of `public`. All SBATCH examples,
`interactive` wrapper variants, and partition-choice guidance now
use `-p public` for non-`htc` workloads. Closes #12.

### Changed

- `skills/sol-skill/SKILL.md`, `references/slurm.md`,
  `references/sessions.md`: replace `-p general` with `-p public`
  in serial / MPI / job-array templates and interactive-shell
  examples; update the "save the larger partition for real
  workloads" guidance to name `public` instead of `general`.
- `evals/evals.example.json`: GPU PyTorch eval expects `-p public`.
- `docs/PLAN.md`: planned `solx` `[gpu]` profile uses
  `partition = "public"`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-23

Substantive content release: situation-first SKILL refactor,
expanded behavior coverage (cluster status queries, OnDemand path,
DTN routing, SLURM-side environment detection), and the eval harness
that gates future releases.

### Skill content

- New "What this skill helps with" overview at the top of `SKILL.md`,
  with cross-cutting conventions (`whoami` substitution, never read
  `~/.ssh/config`, always preview destructive operations) called out
  explicitly.
- New "Disclaimer" section at the end of `SKILL.md` (personal
  toolkit, not affiliated with ASU Research Computing,
  <https://docs.rc.asu.edu/> is authoritative, use cautiously, no
  warranty).
- Situation-first organization throughout: each section opens with
  the user situation it addresses, not the technique it employs.
- New consolidated section **"Getting the Software You Need on
  Sol"** covering `module load`, Python via
  [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (with `UV_CACHE_DIR` pointed at
  `/scratch`), R `tinytex` for LaTeX, and `~/.local`/`~/opt` for
  everything else. Replaces the previous separate Modules / Python /
  LaTeX sections.
- New section **"Using a Service That Runs on Sol, From Your
  Laptop"** covering Open OnDemand (lowest friction for casual
  GPU/Jupyter use) and the manual `ssh -L … -J …` chain for
  terminal-driven workflows. Replaces the previous "Sessions and
  Tunneling".
- New section **"Asking the Cluster About Yourself and Your Jobs"** —
  situational map from common status questions ("what jobs do I
  have?", "what's my fairshare?", "why is my job pending?", "what
  accounts can I use?") to the right SLURM command, with Sol
  wrappers (`myjobs`, `mysacct`, `myaccounts`, `myfairshare`,
  `summary`, `sq`, `showparts`, `showgpus`, `showlimited`, `seff`)
  named where they save real formatting work or encapsulate
  non-trivial calculation.
- "Detecting the Environment" rewritten around three SLURM-side
  signals: `command -v sacctmgr` empty → not on Sol;
  `sacctmgr -n show cluster format=cluster` returns the cluster
  name; `$SLURM_JOB_ID` distinguishes login node (unset) from
  compute node inside an allocation (set). Drops `hostname` parsing
  in favor of cleaner Slurm-only signals.
- "Submitting Jobs" teaches partition choice explicitly: route
  "lightweight / quick / debug" workloads to `htc`, save `general`
  for jobs that genuinely need larger nodes. Calls out that the
  `interactive` wrapper already defaults to `-p htc -q public -c 1
  -t 0-4`. Points at the prebuilt SBATCH templates under
  `/packages/public/sol-sbatch-templates/templates/` (serial, MPI in
  five MPI-stack variants, Python, R, MATLAB, rclone).
- "Transferring Data" routes large transfers through the Sol Data
  Transfer Node (`soldtn` / `dtn` shortcut) instead of the login
  node.
- `references/sessions.md`: ASCII tunnel diagram replaced with a
  Mermaid `flowchart LR`.

### Repo / contributor surface

- [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md): the layered (L0–L3) eval
  harness, the mock Sol environment, the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` sandbox
  trick for fair baseline comparisons, and skill-design guidelines
  (situation first; load-bearing decisions in `SKILL.md`, detail in
  `references/`).
- [`docs/coverage.md`](docs/coverage.md): traffic-light coverage
  matrix grouped by SKILL.md section. Status of each behavior
  (🟢 tested / 🟡 documented / 🔴 gap / ⚪ roadmap) is updated
  manually before each release.
- `evals/`: harness scaffolding — sanitized example evals, mock Sol
  environment (PATH shims for `hostname`, `module`, `srun`, `sbatch`,
  `scancel`, `squeue`, `ssh`; fake `$HOME` with synthetic Sol warning
  CSVs), runner stub, and `build_sandbox_home.sh`.

### Verified

- 23 of 51 tracked behaviors are 🟢 tested for v0.2.0 (up from 0 in
  v0.1.0). Verification was hand-orchestrated across five eval
  iterations on a Sol login. See `docs/coverage.md` for the matrix
  and `DEVELOPMENT.md` for methodology.

### Removed

- `references/solx.md` (was a stub; deferred along with the rest of
  the `solx` surface).
- `docs/stage-1-skill.md` — Stage 1 deliverables shipped; the
  `solx`-conditional items were superseded by the no-solx design.

### Notes

- `solx`, an optional one-command laptop CLI, is on the roadmap (see
  [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md)) but is **not** part of this
  release. The skill works end-to-end without it.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

Initial public release. Restructured the repo to follow the
agentskills.io-compatible layout (skill content under
`skills/sol-skill/`), added the `sol_renew.py` script for
CSV-driven `/scratch` renewal, and shipped the original references
(`module.md`, `scratch.md`, `sharing.md`, `slurm.md`).
